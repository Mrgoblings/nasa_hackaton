            <br> <br> Mercury is the planet that is the closest to the Sun. It is also the smallest planet in the Solar system. An interesting thing about the planet is that it's surface temperature can experience massive changes depending on the time
            . At night the temperature can get as low as -176°C and during the day it can reach 427 °C.

            <img src="./images/Venus.png" style="display:block;width:45%;float:right;margin-right:-47%;">
            <br> Venus is the second planet in the Solar system and it is similar in size with Earth. Although Mercury is the planet that is closest to the Sun it is not the one with the highest temperatures, Venus is the hottest. That is because of it's
            dense atmosphere. Venus is also the brightest night sky object other than the moon, because of that it is also called "morning star" or "evening star".

            <br> Earth is the third planet from the Solar system and the only place in the known universe that can support life , it is our home. About 71% of it's surface is covered with water. Earth has only one natural satellite and that is the Moon.
            It is the largest satellite relative to the size of the planet in the Solar system.

                <img src="./images/Mars.png" style="display:block;width:45%;float:right;margin-right:-47%;">
                <br> Mars is the fourth planet in the Solar system and it is the second smallest. It is also known as the "Red Planet". It is called like that, because of the iron oxide on it's surface. Mars has the highest peak in the Solar system which
                is situated on the volcano Olympus Mons. It is also our best bet for colonizing as it has gravity similar to that of Earth and the temperatures and atmospheric pressure are survivable with the right equipment.

            <img src="./images/Jupiter.png" style="display:block;width:45%;float:right;margin-right:-47%;">
            <br> Jupiter is the fifth planet in the solar system and it is also the biggest one. It is so massive that it's mass is more than 2.5 times more than the mass of all other planets in the Solar system combined. Jupiter is a gas giant and as
            such it does not have a solid surface to step on. The planet has constant storms raging within it. The interaction between these storms is what has created "The Great Red Spot" which is a storm with a diameter 1.3 times larger that that of
            Earth.

            <br> Saturn is the sixth planet in the Solar system and it is the second largest after Jupiter. Just like Jupiter it is also a gas giant and does not have a solid surface. It is only one of two planets that have large visible rings in the
            Solar system. The planet has 83 moons, from which the most interesting is Titan, because although it is a moon it is bigger than Mercury. It is also the only moon in the Solar system with a substantial atmosphere.

            <br> Uranus is the seventh planet in the solar system. It is also a gas giant and it is the coldest planet in the system with temperatures as low as −224 °C. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the
            Solar System.The Uranian system has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north and south poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have their equators

            <br> Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth.It also
            has spots like Jupiter , for example it's great black spot.s
